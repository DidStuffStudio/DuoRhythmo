Tobii Unity SDK for Desktop - Demo Scene Setup in Unity
=================================================

Note: The demo scenes require Unity 5.3.7f1 or higher (script files work on Unity 5.0/4.5 or higher )

## Add Demo Scenes to Build
Before you run the demo scenes, add them to the project build:
`Tools` -> `Add Tobii SDK Demo Scenes To Build`

This makes sure the navigation between scenes works without "scene not found" errors.
